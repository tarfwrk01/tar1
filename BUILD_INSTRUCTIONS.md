# Testing Navigation Bar Styling

## The Problem
Navigation bar styling does NOT work in Expo Go during development. This is a known limitation.

## Solution: Build Production APK

### Method 1: EAS Build (Recommended)
```bash
# Install EAS CLI if not already installed
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Build preview APK
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### Method 2: Local Build
```bash
# Build locally (requires Android Studio setup)
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

## What to Expect
- ✅ Navigation bar will be BLACK in production builds
- ✅ Navigation buttons will be WHITE (light content)
- ✅ Consistent styling across all screens

## Current Configuration
Your app is already properly configured:
- ✅ app.json has correct navigationBar settings
- ✅ expo-navigation-bar plugin is added
- ✅ All layouts call setNavigationBarBlack()
- ✅ Utility function has proper error handling

## Development Workaround
During development in Expo Go:
- Navigation bar will remain white/system default
- This is NORMAL and expected behavior
- Focus on other UI elements during development
- Test navigation bar in production builds only

## Verification
After building, you should see:
- Black navigation bar background
- White navigation buttons (back, home, recent apps)
- Consistent appearance across all app screens
